Zombie Apocalypse is a mini First Person Shooter made in less than 24 hours for the VR Game Jam Hackathon in East London organized by Realities Center which consist in building a Virtual Reality game in a very short period of time.

The idea behind Zombie Apocalypse was to build a small and intuitive VR experience using the Oculus Rift and the Touch Controllers while playing with the emotions of the player (mainly fear and excitement).

The project is leveraging the power of HTML5 and Javascript by using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/).
